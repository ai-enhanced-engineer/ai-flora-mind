# EDA Modeling Strategy Summary

## Context

The goal of this document is to **communicate the key results** from our comprehensive exploratory data analysis and **translate them into a spectrum of modeling approaches** from which we can choose based on their specific characteristics. This strategic framework enables data-driven model selection by matching EDA discoveries with appropriate algorithms, considering factors such as accuracy requirements, interpretability needs, implementation complexity, and computational resources.

Based on comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the Iris dataset (see `research/eda/EDA.ipynb` for detailed analysis), this document presents the complete modeling strategy spectrum with detailed findings and implementation recommendations.

## Executive Summary

Our comprehensive EDA has revealed clear patterns that directly inform our modeling strategy. We will implement a **phased approach** targeting 5 models across 2 primary phases:

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Hours):** Implement and evaluate three baseline models to establish benchmarks:
- **Rule-Based Heuristic** leveraging perfect Setosa separation (97% accuracy, zero complexity)
- **Decision Tree** for interpretable ML with feature importance insights
- **Logistic Regression** for statistical baseline with probability outputs

**Phase 2 (Short-term - Days):** Implement two optimization models:
- **Random Forest** for best balance of accuracy (98-99%) and interpretability
- **k-Nearest Neighbors** to exploit discovered clustering patterns

This strategy directly leverages our key EDA discoveries: perfect Setosa separability via petal features, high feature correlations enabling engineered features, and confirmed linear separability in reduced dimensions. By focusing on these 5 models, we expect to achieve 97-99% accuracy while maintaining interpretability options from perfect (heuristic) to medium (Random Forest), delivering production-ready solutions within days.

The phased approach minimizes risk, allows for early value delivery, and provides flexibility to stop at any phase based on performance requirements. Each model is specifically chosen to exploit particular patterns discovered in our data, ensuring our modeling efforts are data-driven rather than arbitrary.

## Key Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Characteristics and Patterns:
Based on our analysis, we have discovered:
- **PERFECT separability**: Setosa via petal features (petal_length < 2.0, petal_width < 0.8)
- **BIMODAL distributions**: Petal features show clear species groupings with distinct peaks
- **HIGH correlations**: Petal length/width (r=0.96), sepal length/petal features (r=0.87, r=0.82)
- **LOW dimensionality**: 92% variance captured in 2 PCA components
- **CLEAN data**: Minimal outliers (0-3 samples), 1 duplicate, no missing values
- **FEATURE hierarchy**: Petal (CV: 0.47-0.64) >> Sepal (CV: 0.14) for discrimination
- **LINEAR separability**: Clear in PCA space and scatter plots, especially petal length vs width
- **CLUSTERING patterns**: t-SNE reveals even clearer species separation than PCA
- **HEURISTIC opportunity**: Simple thresholds can achieve ~97% accuracy
- **VERSICOLOR/VIRGINICA overlap**: Main classification challenge, requires sophisticated boundaries
- **ENGINEERED features**: 10 new features with petal_area (CV: 0.813) as top discriminator
