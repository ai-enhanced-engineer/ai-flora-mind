# Random Forest Iris Classifier Experiment

## Executive Summary

This experiment implemented a Random Forest classifier for iris species classification through three progressive experiments, evolving from basic performance validation to production-ready models with overfitting prevention. The journey began with a split experiment achieving 93.3% accuracy, advanced to comprehensive validation revealing 96% performance with concerning overfitting (100% training vs 96% OOB), and culminated in a regularized production model maintaining 96% performance while reducing overfitting by 32%.

The key breakthrough was implementing model-specific feature engineering through a ModelType enum, enabling the Random Forest to leverage all 14 features (4 original + 10 engineered) while other models use appropriate subsets. This approach validated EDA findings showing petal-related features consistently dominate (65-70% importance) across all configurations.

- **Production readiness**: Balanced 96% performance with controlled complexity
- **Feature engineering success**: 60-65% importance from engineered features

## Overview

This experiment implements a Random Forest classifier for the Iris dataset through **three progressive experiments**, each building on insights from the previous one. The goal is to achieve near-maximal accuracy (98-99%) while validating EDA findings and addressing model reliability concerns.

## Rationale

Random Forest was chosen based on EDA insights that revealed:
- **Complex interactions**: petal_area vs sepal_area joint classification patterns
- **Non-linear patterns**: Bimodal distributions and hierarchical feature importance
- **Multiple simple rules**: Various splitting rules that an ensemble can capture
- **Feature correlations**: RF handles correlated features through random subset selection

## Feature Strategy

**All 14 features approach**:
- **4 original features**: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
- **10 engineered features**: petal_area, sepal_area, aspect ratios, binary flags (is_likely_setosa), etc.

This "kitchen sink" approach lets Random Forest automatically select the most useful splits without manual feature selection, ensuring no EDA-discovered patterns are lost.
