Random Forest Iris Classifier Module

This module implements a Random Forest classifier for the Iris dataset based on
comprehensive EDA findings. The classifier uses all original features plus
engineered features to achieve near-maximal accuracy through ensemble learning.

Key Features:
- Uses all 14 features (4 original + 10 engineered from EDA)
- Handles complex feature interactions and non-linear patterns
- Validates EDA findings through feature importance analysis
- Targets 98-99% accuracy with moderate interpretability
